# USGBC_MAP

This visualization tool provides users a quick mapping of all the green buildings certified by LEED, up to 2021-12-18, on both a global scale and for selected countries (currently including the US and China).

The tool is deployed online at: https://susdata.shinyapps.io/USGBC_Map/. Sorry for the long loading time due to the large size of the raw data. You can download the original USGBC dataset and incorporate it into the R file to fit you purposes (put it under the Data folder, change to .csv). The up-to-date project dataset can be downloaded from the USGBC project site: https://www.usgbc.org/projects, or directly via the AWS Cloud at: https://usgbc-projects.s3.amazonaws.com/PublicLEEDProjectDirectory.xlsx

You are NOT allowed to re-distribute this tool without consent of the author.
